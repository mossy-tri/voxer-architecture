## Overview

Legacy web client application described as "the unified web product." Built with Backbone.js/Marionette, RequireJS for AMD modules, Grunt for build automation, and jQuery/Bootstrap for UI. Uses Bower for front-end dependency management and includes components like video.js, SoundManager2 for audio, and BinaryJS for real-time communication. Recent work includes timeout increases for chat summarization API calls (30s to 120s) and banner permission management. This appears to be an older web client compared to the newer React Native-based [Web Client](webclient.md).
