GitHub repository: https://github.com/voxer/webclient

## Overview

Modern cross-platform client built with React Native and Expo, supporting web, iOS, and Android platforms. Uses expo-router for navigation, WatermelonDB for local data persistence, and Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind) for styling. Includes Material-UI components for web UI and expo-audio for audio handling. The codebase is actively being developed with recent focus on unit testing setup (Jest), file refactoring, and MessageList/Sidebar component improvements.
