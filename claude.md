# Voxer Architecture Documentation

This repository contains architectural documentation for the Voxer system, optimized for viewing in Obsidian.

## Documentation Conventions

### Linking
- Use Obsidian wiki-style links: `[[Document Name]]`
- Link to specific sections: `[[Document Name#Section]]`
- Use aliases when needed: `[[Document Name|Display Text]]`

### Structure
- Each major system component gets its own document
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `web-client.md`, `node-router.md`)
- Organize related documents in folders as needed

### Content Guidelines
- Focus on architectural decisions and system design
- Include diagrams where helpful (Obsidian supports embedded images)
- Document data flows and component interactions
- Note dependencies between systems
- Avoid backlinking - let Obsidian handle link discovery

## Getting Started

1. Open this folder in Obsidian
2. Start with overview documents to understand the high-level architecture
3. Follow links to dive deeper into specific components
4. Use the graph view to visualize relationships between components
